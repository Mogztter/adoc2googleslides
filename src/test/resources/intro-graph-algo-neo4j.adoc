==== When not to use graphs

Note when not to use graph and graph algorithms!

[square]
* Questions with just a few connections or flat (not nested).
* Questions solved with specific, well-crafted queries.
* Simple statistical results (sums, averages, ratios).
** Example: Regular reporting based on defined criteria and well-organized data:

Average rainfall calculation is an example of a simple statistical result, where no graph analytics is required.

=== Graph Structure

A graph consists of nodes (also called vertices), which are connected by relationships (also called edges or links).

==== Random network

In a completely average distribution of relationships per node, a random network is formed with no hierarchies.
All nodes have the same probability of being attached to any other node.
However, average distribution is only valid when we are dealing with a set of independent observations.

==== Structured network

=== Summary

You have learned a lot about graphs, their structure, and how graph algorithms are applied to solve real-world problems.
