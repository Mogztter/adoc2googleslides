== Working with the sample data

A best practice when creating a graph with Cypher is to use the `MERGE` statement.
When creating nodes, you specify the properties in the `MERGE` statement to ensure that nodes with the same property values are not duplicated in the graph.
For large graphs, the node properties used for the MERGE should have uniqueness constraints on them.
